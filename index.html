    <h1>My Favorite Hobby<br>Painting</h1>
    <section id="bio">
        <p>I like painting because i can relax and just paint.I like to to look at stuff online and get ideas most of the time I just watch them for fun.I frequently use creative outlets such as writing, painting, and drawing.Painting also gives me a chance to express my feelings and emotions without words.I also helps my memory and helps me make sure i dont go through depression or anxiety.Painting is a good way for me to practice my skills and hone them so I can paint to my best ability</p>
